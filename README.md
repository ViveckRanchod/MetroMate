# MetroMate: A Mobile Bus App

> MetroMate is aimed at providing a more comfortable and convenient experience for drivers and commuters of the MetroBus operation. The features include commuters being able to search for bus stops, search for available bus times, track the live location of a bus, and manage their trips on their account. Drivers are able to enable tracking, submit a report of an event i.e. traffic delays, protests, or any other event type.

Below is a website link attached that contains more details about the application, the developers, and a video outlining the functional features.
